# Contributing to Hello World

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Hello World**! This project aims to help programming beginners by providing simple programs that print the "Hello World" message in various programming languages. Whether you're an experienced developer or just getting started, we'd love to have your contributions.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository
First, fork the repository to create your own copy. You can do this by clicking the "Fork" button on the project’s GitHub page.

### 2. Create a New Branch
Before making changes, create a new branch in your fork. This helps keep your contributions organized and makes it easier for us to review your pull request.

```bash
git checkout -b add-<language-name>
```

For example:
```bash
git checkout -b add-python-hello-world
```

### 3. Add Your "Hello World" Program
Create a new file in the appropriate directory, or if a directory for the language doesn't exist, feel free to create one.

- The file should be named in a way that reflects the programming language you’re contributing to. For example, a Python file should be named `hello_world.py`, and a Java file should be named `HelloWorld.java`.
- The program should only print or display the message "Hello World" in the respective language.

Example:
```python
# Python
print("Hello World")
```

```java
// Java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

### 4. Update the Documentation
If you’re adding a new language, don’t forget to add your language to the project’s README file under the list of available languages. Provide the name of the language and a link to your file.

### 5. Commit and Push Your Changes
Once your changes are ready, commit them with a meaningful message.

```bash
git add <file-name>
git commit -m "Add Hello World in <language>"
```

Push your changes to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request
Once you've pushed your changes, create a pull request (PR) to the main repository. In your PR description, please include:
- The name of the language you're contributing to.
- Any relevant notes or details.

Our team will review your PR and provide feedback if needed. We aim to respond to contributions as quickly as possible.

## Contribution Tips
- Ensure your code is clean and adheres to the standard syntax of the language.
- The program should only output "Hello World" (without extra formatting unless it's essential in the language).
- Contributions are welcome from everyone, regardless of experience level. Feel free to ask questions if you need help with Git or the project.

We’re excited to see your contributions! Happy coding!
